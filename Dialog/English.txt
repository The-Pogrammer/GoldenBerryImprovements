GOLDENBERRYIMPROVEMENTS_SETTINGS_DISABLE_RETRY=
This disables the retry in the menu when you have the golden berry
so you don't accidentally restart. (Note: if you turn this on and
back off, retry will not get reset. Something else like exiting
the chapter must be done to reset it.)

GOLDENBERRYIMPROVEMENTS_SETTINGS_SPEEDUP_DOORS=
This makes door hitboxes instantly vanish when you have the golden
berry, though the sound and animation don't reflect that.

GOLDENBERRYIMPROVEMENTS_SETTINGS_SKIP_CUTSCENES=
This skips cutscenes instantly when you have the golden berry.

GOLDENBERRYIMPROVEMENTS_SETTINGS_SEGMENTING_MODE=
This will set the last checkpoint to your spawnpoint so you can practice doing each checkpoint deathless.
